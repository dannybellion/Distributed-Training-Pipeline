# Distributed Training Pipeline

A distributed training pipeline for transformer language models using PyTorch, Hugging Face, and Accelerate for efficient multi-GPU training.

## Project Context and Motivation

### Modern NLP Challenges
Training large-scale transformer-based language models requires vast datasets and significant computational resources. Distributed training techniques help:
- Manage computational demands efficiently.
- Accelerate experimentation and iteration cycles.
- Optimize GPU cluster utilization.
- Facilitate rapid development of large-scale models.

### Objectives
   - Train a moderately sized transformer model (e.g., DistilBERT or small GPT-2) using multi-GPU setups, reflecting real-world industry practices.
   - Efficient data handling.
   - Use of robust distributed frameworks.
   - Application of optimizations like mixed-precision training.
   - Logging metrics, saving checkpoints, and ensuring reproducibility.


## Key Technical Concepts

### 1. Transformer-Based Models
Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT) leverage attention mechanisms to process token sequences efficiently, enabling state-of-the-art performance in language understanding and generation.

### 2. Tokenization and Preprocessing
- Text is converted to token IDs using tools like Hugging Face's `AutoTokenizer`.
- Preprocessing includes cleaning, normalizing, and segmenting text into fixed-length sequences suitable for GPU memory.

### 3. Distributed Training and Data Parallelism
- Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) ensures:
  - Each GPU processes a portion of training data.
  - Gradients synchronize across GPUs to update a shared model.
- Libraries like Hugging Face's `accelerate` simplify distributed training setups.

### 4. Mixed-Precision Training
- Training with half-precision (float16) reduces memory usage and speeds up computations without compromising quality.

### 5. Experiment Tracking and Logging
- Tools like Weights & Biases track metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy, perplexity), enabling easy run comparisons and visualizations.

### 6. Evaluation and Checkpointing
- Periodic evaluation on a validation set prevents overfitting and guides hyperparameter tuning.
- Checkpoints save model states, allowing training resumption and result analysis.


## Code Structure

The implementation is organized into several core modules:

### Training Pipeline (`src/train.py`)
- Main training loop with distributed setup
- Gradient accumulation and mixed precision
- Regular validation and checkpointing
- Progress logging with tqdm

### Dataset Handling (`src/dataset.py`)
```python
class TextDataset:
    """Efficient text dataset with dynamic padding
    Handles both masked and causal language modeling"""
```
- Custom collation for batching
- Automatic tokenization and padding
- Configurable sequence length

### Model Management (`src/model.py`)
- Loads models from Hugging Face hub
- Supports various architectures (BERT, GPT, etc)
- Handles tokenizer configuration

### Utilities (`src/utils.py`)
- Reproducibility (seed setting)
- Config loading/parsing
- Checkpoint management
- Logging setup
